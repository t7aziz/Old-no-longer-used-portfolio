                            Nicknamed "Gimpy", this robot is a project I did for a computer engineering class in 2020.
            Gimpy is a mobile, battery powered, fully automated 2 legged crwaling robot. However, it was not orignally 
            supposed to be gimpy. The original plan was planning on creating a four legged walking robot, 
            but unfortunately did not have the parts available to do so. I was able to compromise and change the design to meet all original goals were met.

                            Gimpy is composed of a plexiglass board, which holds together metal and 3D printed brackets.
            These brackets are connected by 3 servo motors in each leg, creating three joints and degrees of freedom.
            An ultrasonic sensor is present on the front for wall detection.
            These components are connected to an Arduino which controls them and delivers power from the 5V battery pack.
            Two wheels are installed on the back so it can drag itself along.
            Gimpy is programmed to crawl forwards, and turn to avoid obstacles. It will change it's walking cycle 
            depending on its proximity to a wall.

                            I hope to learn more about power electronics and feedback control during my studies at Waterloo and co-ops, 
            and reengineer this project one day with a fresh solution and new hardware.
